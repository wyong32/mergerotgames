  <h3>How to Play Merge Rot</h3>
  <p>
    Merge Rot is more than just a puzzle game—it’s a physics-based merge experience full of absurd humor, clever strategy, and meme-fueled madness. In Merge Rot, you drop items into a cup. When two identical items touch, they merge into a more evolved version. Each Merge Rot evolution is wackier than the last, making gameplay hilarious, unpredictable, and highly addictive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every move in Merge Rot counts. Items are affected by gravity and momentum, so you need to be deliberate. Random drops might block key areas, while thoughtful placement leads to epic chain reactions. Merge Rot rewards strategy, experimentation, and timing.
  </p>

  <h3>Merge Rot Game Themes</h3>
  <p>
    Merge Rot offers four core themes: <strong>Italian Brainrot</strong>, <strong>Dog</strong>, <strong>Cat</strong>, and <strong>Capybara</strong>. Each Merge Rot theme comes with its own bizarre item sets and animations. In the Italian Brainrot theme, for example, you might start with tiny espresso cups that evolve into grandma riding a Vespa or a meatball cannon. In the Dog theme, dogs transform into dancing hotdogs, flying bones, or bizarre barking robots. Merge Rot constantly surprises you with every combination.
  </p>
  <p>
    These themes enhance the Merge Rot gameplay loop while also appealing to meme lovers and younger audiences. No two Merge Rot sessions feel the same—every merge brings something new to the screen.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Merge Rot Is Addictive</h3>
  <p>
    Merge Rot has earned viral popularity because of its humor, accessibility, and chaos. Unlike traditional puzzle games, Merge Rot breaks the rules by encouraging illogical evolutions and over-the-top visuals. Merge Rot blends logic and nonsense in a way that keeps players laughing while thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Merge Rot is also easy to access. There are no downloads. You can open Merge Rot in any browser on desktop, mobile, or tablet. It loads instantly, allowing players to jump into a Merge Rot session without delay. The quick start and fast-paced gameplay make Merge Rot perfect for short breaks or long play sessions.
  </p>

  <h3>Merge Rot Mechanics</h3>
  <p>
    The Merge Rot cup is your game board. Drop items from the top of the screen and let physics do the rest. Merge Rot automatically merges two identical items when they collide. Each successful merge earns you points and creates more room in the cup.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you progress, items get bigger, the cup fills faster, and Merge Rot becomes more intense. Eventually, if you run out of space, your Merge Rot session ends. The challenge is in how long you can survive and how high you can score before the cup overflows.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> In Merge Rot, don’t drop pieces randomly. Position each one to maximize merging potential.</li>
