        <h2>2048 Drop – Gravity-Based Number Puzzle Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>2048 Drop</strong> is a creative evolution of the iconic number puzzle game, introducing a new twist: gravity! Instead of sliding tiles across a grid, in <strong>2048 Drop</strong>, numbers fall from above like Tetris blocks. Merge matching numbers as they land and stack—your goal is still to reach that glorious <strong>2048 Drop</strong> tile, but how you get there is entirely different!
        </p>
    
        <h2>What is 2048 Drop?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>2048 Drop</strong> is a free-to-play online game that combines the strategic thinking of 2048 with the dynamic motion of falling block games. Numbered tiles drop from the top of the screen, and you must place them strategically to merge and reach the highest possible number. It’s a fresh, fast-paced take on the beloved formula—and once you start, it’s hard to stop.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How to Play 2048 Drop</h2>
        <p>
          In <strong>2048 Drop</strong>, numbered tiles fall one at a time. Use your arrow keys or on-screen controls to move the tiles left or right before they land. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with a doubled value. The game continues until there is no space left to drop new tiles—so every placement counts.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>left/right arrow keys</strong> to guide falling tiles</li>
          <li>Merge tiles with the same number to increase value</li>
          <li>Stack carefully to create space for future drops</li>
          <li>Reach the <strong>2048 Drop</strong> tile—or go even further!</li>
          <li>Game over if the stack reaches the top</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Features of 2048 Drop</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gravity-Based Gameplay:</strong> A thrilling twist on classic 2048</li>

        <h2>Why Play 2048 Drop?</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
    
        <h2>Tips & Tricks for 2048 Drop</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Keep the center column low</strong> to avoid running out of space</li>
          <li><strong>Plan your merges</strong>—don’t rush each drop</li>
          <li><strong>Use walls to your advantage</strong> to set up merges</li>
          <li><strong>Combine downward momentum</strong> with strategy to prevent pileups</li>

        </ol>
    
        <h2>2048 Drop vs Classic 2048</h2>
        <p>
          While both games share the same goal—merging numbers to reach the 2048 tile—the way you play <strong>2048 Drop</strong> is dramatically different. In the original 2048, you slide an entire grid; in <strong>2048 Drop</strong>, tiles fall one-by-one, and gravity takes control. This adds a new layer of difficulty and unpredictability, making <strong>2048 Drop</strong> a worthy successor and a standout among puzzle games.
        </p>

        <h3>What makes 2048 Drop different from 2048?</h3>
        <p>In <strong>2048 Drop</strong>, tiles fall from the top instead of sliding. This introduces physics-based gameplay and more complex merging strategies.</p>

        <h2>Tung Sahur Horror – When Sahur Becomes a Nightmare</h2>
        <p>
          You’ve heard the call. “Tung… Tung… Tung… Sahur…”  
          But what if that call didn’t come from a cheerful neighborhood drummer—but something else?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong> is a psychological horror game that twists the beloved Indonesian sahur meme into something truly sinister. Set in a dark alleyway in the early morning hours, <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong> asks one terrifying question: what if the sound of the sahur drum didn’t wake you—but followed you?
        </p>
    
        <h2>What is Tung Sahur Horror?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong> is an indie first-person horror game inspired by brainrot aesthetics, Indonesian folklore, and meme culture. You play as a sleeper who awakens in the dead of night, only to realize the sahur drums are… wrong. You must explore your haunted neighborhood, solve environmental puzzles, avoid the Sahur Entity, and uncover the true origin of the “Tung” that echoes endlessly.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Gameplay of Tung Sahur Horror</h2>
        <p>
          In <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong>, exploration and survival are key. Every round of drums might bring comfort—or death. The Sahur Entity will stalk you by sound. You must hide, listen, and run to survive. The gameplay involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exploring maze-like alleyways</li>
          <li>Hiding from the Sahur Entity</li>
          <li>Using audio clues from “Tung!” echoes to find safe paths</li>
          <li>Solving sahur-themed puzzles under pressure</li>

        </ul>
    
        <h2>Why Tung Sahur Horror Feels Real</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong> builds dread slowly. Familiar sahur chants play softly at first, then begin to warp—stretching, distorting, multiplying. You start to question what you’re hearing. The shadow at the corner of your screen. The extra “Tung!” in the distance. Is it real? Or is it the game?
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by regional tradition and the uniquely surreal tone of brainrot culture, <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong> feels both hilarious and terrifying. It’s a meme turned monster. And it works.
        </p>
    
        <h2>How to Survive in Tung Sahur Horror</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Use headphones</strong>—sound is your best tool</li>
          <li><strong>Don’t trust every “Tung”</strong>—some are lures</li>
          <li><strong>Turn off your flashlight when hiding</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Conserve stamina</strong>—you’ll need it to escape</li>
          <li><strong>Watch the wall graffiti</strong>—clues are everywhere in <strong>Tung Sahur Horror</strong></li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Characters in Tung Sahur Horror</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Sahur Entity:</strong> Tall, cloaked, face hidden behind a broken loudspeaker</li>
          <li><strong>The Player:</strong> A sleeper with fragmented memories of sahur</li>
          <li><strong>Boneca's Echo:</strong> Sometimes her voice overlaps the drumbeats</li>
          <li><strong>U Din Din Dun’s Shadow:</strong> Occasionally seen watching you from rooftops</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Is Tung Sahur Horror for You?</h2>
