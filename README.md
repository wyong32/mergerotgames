## Vercel Deployment

This project is optimized for **Vercel** deployment:

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel
2. **Build command**: `npm run build`
3. **Output directory**: `dist`
4. **SPA routing** is handled by `vercel.json`

### Auto-deployment
- Push to main branch → automatic deployment
- Pull requests → preview deployments

### Configuration
- `vercel.json` - Handles SPA routing and caching
- All other routes redirect to `index.html`
- Static assets get optimized caching headers

```
