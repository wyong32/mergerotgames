# Merge Rot

**Merge Rot** is a chaotic and brain-melting merge game where logic dies, and cursed combinations are born.

> It's not just a game... it's a lifestyle of *rot*.

## What Is Merge Rot?

In **Merge Rot**, you drag-and-drop to merge the same units...  
...until they become something *worse*.

From suspicious tomatoes to sentient espresso cups, each evolution is more absurd than the last. There's no end. Just rot.

This game was inspired by Italian Brainrot memes, chaotic animation loops, and the universal human urge to make things worse *on purpose*.
